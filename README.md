# BuasSFML
My game for the Buas intake, using SFML to draw.

The game is about a tank lost in an apolypse zombie world, his goal is to survive as many waves as possible. He kills zombies and collect their brains. He can use to brains to get stronger by doing research, making it easier to get further, but the longer you last the harder it gets.
